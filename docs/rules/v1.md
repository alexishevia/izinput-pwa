## Actions

Objects in the system can only be created/modified/deleted using the following actions:

### v1 accounts/create

Use this action to create a new account.

Example:

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "accounts/create",
  "payload": {
    "id": "9bf1e1ce-a779-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002",
    "name": "Savings",
    "initialBalance": 300,
    "modifiedAt": "2020-06-05T22:13:25.926Z",
  }
}
```

Rules:

1. IF the account `id` is unique (no other accounts with the same `id` exist)  
    AND all account fields are included in `payload`  
    AND all account field values have the correct type  
   THEN an account MUST be created using the `payload` values.

Notes:

1. While not required, it is recommended to use UUIDs for account ids.
   Using UUIDs diminishes the probability of unwanted conflicts.

### v1 accounts/update

Use this action to update an existing account.

Example:
(in this example I'm updating the initialBalance field for the account created above)

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "accounts/update",
  "payload": {
    "id": "9bf1e1ce-a779-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002",
    "initialBalance": 120.50,
    "modifiedAt": "2020-06-05T22:16:42.565Z"
  }
}
```

Rules:

1. IF the account `id` is not unique (an account with the same `id` already exists)  
    AND a valid `payload.modifiedAt` value is included  
    AND `payload.modifiedAt` is later than the existing account's `modifiedAt`  
   THEN the data in `action.payload` must be merged with the existing account's data.  
    ie:  
    fields included in `action.payload` override the same fields in the existing account  
    fields in the existing account that are NOT included in `action.payload` remain unchanged

### v1 categories/create

Use this action to create a new category.

Example:

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "categories/create",
  "payload": {
    "id": "9bf1e1ce-a779-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002",
    "name": "Savings",
    "modifiedAt": "2020-06-05T22:13:25.926Z",
    "deleted": false
  }
}
```

Rules:

1. IF the category `id` is unique (no other categories with the same `id` exist)  
    AND all category fields are included in `payload`  
    AND all category field values have the correct type  
    AND `payload.deleted` is `false`  
   THEN a category MUST be created using the `payload` values.

### v1 categories/update

Use this action to update an existing category.

Note: to delete a category, use `categories/delete` instead.

Example:
(in this example I'm updating the name field for the category created above)

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "categories/update",
  "payload": {
    "id": "9bf1e1ce-a779-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002",
    "name": "Retirement Fund",
    "modifiedAt": "2020-06-05T22:16:42.565Z"
  }
}
```

Rules:

1. IF the category `id` is not unique (a category with the same `id` already exists)  
    AND a valid `payload.modifiedAt` value is included  
    AND `payload.modifiedAt` is later than the existing category's `modifiedAt`  
    AND `payload.deleted` is NOT `false`  
   THEN the data in `action.payload` must be merged with the existing category's data.  
    ie:  
    fields included in `action.payload` override the same fields in the existing category  
    fields in the existing category that are NOT included in `action.payload` remain unchanged

### v1 categories/delete

Use this action to delete an existing category.

Example:

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "categories/delete",
  "payload": {
    "id: "aa39da77-2ad2-43a8-ad01-2bb096db3186",
    "modifiedAt": "2020-06-05T22:16:42.565Z"
  }
}
```

Rules:

1. IF the category `id` is not unique (a category with the same `id` already exists)  
    AND a valid `payload.modifiedAt` value is included  
    AND `payload.modifiedAt` is later than the existing category's `modifiedAt`  
   THEN the category's `deleted` field must be set to `true`
   THEN the category's `modifiedAt` must be set to `payload.modifiedAt`

### v1 incomes/create

Use this action to create a income.

Example:

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "incomes/create",
  "payload": {
    "id": "aa39da77-2ad2-43a8-ad01-2bb096db3186",
    "amount": 13.5,
    "accountID": "1dc149bc-7165-43f7-addf-5a4e2f02122c",
    "categoryID": "49f4d831-feb2-498b-8079-1c5b61dc9301",
    "description": "Freelance Project",
    "transactionDate": "2019-10-12",
    "modifiedAt": "2019-10-12T12:25:35.059Z",
    "deleted": false
  }
}
```

Rules:

1. IF the income `id` is unique (no other incomes with the same `id` exist)  
    AND all income fields are included in `payload`  
    AND all income field values have the correct type  
    AND the `payload.accountID` account exists  
    AND the `payload.categoryID` category exists  
    AND `payload.deleted` is `false`  
   THEN a income MUST be created using the `payload` values.

Notes:

1. While not required, it is recommended to use UUIDs for income ids.
   Using UUIDs diminishes the probability of unwanted conflicts.

### v1 incomes/update

Use this action to update a income

Note: to delete a income, use `incomes/delete` instead.

Example:
(in this example I'm updating the amount field for the transaction created above)

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "incomes/update",
  "payload": {
    "id: "aa39da77-2ad2-43a8-ad01-2bb096db3186",
    "amount": 135,
    "modifiedAt": "2019-10-12T02:49:00.704Z"
  }
}
```

Rules:

1. IF the income `id` is not unique (another income with the same `id` already exists)  
    AND a valid `payload.modifiedAt` value is included  
    AND `payload.modifiedAt` is later than the existing income's `modifiedAt`  
    AND `payload.deleted` is NOT `false`  
   THEN the data in `action.payload` must be merged with the existing income's data.  
    ie:  
    fields included in `action.payload` override the same fields in the existing income  
    fields in the existing income that are NOT included in `action.payload` remain unchanged

    AND a valid `payload.modifiedAt` value is included  
    AND `payload.modifiedAt` is later than the existing income's `modifiedAt`  
   THEN the income's `deleted` field must be set to `true`
   THEN the income's `modifiedAt` must be set to `payload.modifiedAt`
