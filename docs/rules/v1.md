# v1 Rules

## Objects (aka Models)

### Transactions

All financial operations in IZ are modeled as "transactions".

Transactions include stuff like:

- paying dinner with your credit card
- buying beer using cash
- receiving a bank transfer from your employer
- etc

A transaction has the following fields:

| field name      | type                             | description                       | example                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| id              | string                           | Unique identifier for the         | "63fe4a30-eceb-11e9-8665-d714a6e36f30" |
| non empty       | transaction.                     |
|                 |                                  |
| amount          | decimal                          | The amount of money sent or       | 13.5                                   |
| bigger than 0   | received.                        |
|                 |                                  |
| type            | enum:                            | Method used for the transaction:  | "CASH"                                 |
| "CASH"          | cash, credit, or bank transfer.  |
| "CREDIT"        |                                  |
| "TRANSFER"      |                                  |
|                 |                                  |
| cashFlow        | enum:                            | Whether you are receiving money   | "INCOME"                               |
| "INCOME"        | (income) or making a payment     |
| "EXPENSE"       | (expense).                       |
|                 |                                  |
| category        | string                           | Categories provide a way to group | "Groceries"                            |
|                 | transactions. Values are defined |
|                 | by the user.                     |
|                 |                                  |
| description     | string                           | Additional notes for the          | "Whole Foods Market"                   |
|                 | transaction.                     |
|                 |                                  |
| transactionDate | string                           | Date the transaction occured.     | "2019-10-12"                           |
| YYYY-MM-DD      |                                  |
|                 |                                  |
| modifiedAt      | string                           | Last date the transaction was     | "2019-10-12T12:25:35.059Z"             |
| full ISO 8601   | modified. (create, update, and   |
| date in UTC     | delete count for "modifiedAt")   |
|                 |                                  |
| deleted         | boolean                          | `true` if transaction has been    | false                                  |
|                 | deleted. `false` otherwise.      |

### Categories

Categories provide a way to group transactions together.

Categories are simple strings, eg:  
"Groceries", "Office Supplies", "Takeout", "Utilities", etc.

The user is free to create as many categories as wanted.

### Initial Savings

At any time, you can ask IZ to display your "available money".

Available money is calculated like this:

```
INITIAL_SAVINGS + all INCOME transactions - all EXPENSE transactions
```

Your "initial savings" is the amount money you had before starting to use IZ.

## Actions

Objects in the system can only be created/modified/deleted using the following actions:

### v1 transactions/create

Use this action to create a new transaction.

Example:

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "transactions/create",
  "payload": {
    "id": "9bf1e1ce-a779-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002",
    "amount": 95.50,
    "type": "CREDIT",
    "cashFlow": "EXPENSE",
    "category": "Groceries",
    "description": "Whole Foods Market",
    "transactionDate": "2020-06-05",
    "modifiedAt": "2020-06-05T22:13:25.926Z",
    "deleted": false
  }
}
```

Rules:

1. IF the transaction `id` is unique (no other transactions with the same `id` exists)  
    AND all transaction fields are included in `payload`  
    AND all transaction field values have the correct type  
    AND `payload.deleted` is NOT `false`  
   THEN a transaction MUST be created using the `payload` values  
   THEN  
    IF `payload.category` is a non empty string  
    AND `payload.category` is new (no other category with the same value exists)  
    THEN a category MUST be created using the `payload.category` value

Notes:

1. While not required, it is recommended transaction `id` values to be UUIDs.
   Using UUIDs diminishes the probability of an unwanted conflict.

### v1 transactions/update

Use this action to update an existing transaction.

Example:
(in this example I'm updating the amount field for the transaction created above)

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "transactions/update",
  "payload": {
    "id": "9bf1e1ce-a779-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002",
    "amount": 120,
    "modifiedAt": "2020-06-05T22:16:42.565Z"
  }
}
```

Rules:

1. IF the transaction `id` is not unique (a transaction with the same `id` already exists)  
    AND a valid `payload.modifiedAt` value is included  
    AND `payload.deleted` is NOT `false`  
    AND `payload.modifiedAt` is later than the existing transaction's `modifiedAt`  
   THEN the data in `action.payload` must be merged with the existing transaction data.  
    ie:  
    fields included in `action.payload` override the same fields in the existing transaction  
    fields in the existing transaction that are NOT included in `action.payload` remain unchanged  
   THEN the transaction's `deleted` field must be set to `false`  
   THEN  
    IF `payload.category` is a non empty string  
    AND `payload.category` is new (no other category with the same value exists)  
    THEN a category MUST be created using the `payload.category` value

### v1 transactions/delete

Use this action to delete an existing transaction.

Example:

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "transactions/delete",
  "payload": {
    "id": "9bf1e1ce-a779-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002",
    "modifiedAt": "2020-06-05T22:16:42.565Z"
  }
}
```

Rules:

1. IF the transaction `id` is not unique (a transaction with the same `id` already exists)  
    AND a valid `payload.modifiedAt` value is included  
    AND `payload.modifiedAt` is later than the existing transaction's `modifiedAt`  
   THEN the transaction's `deleted` field must be set to `true`
   THEN the transaction's `modifiedAt` must be set to `payload.modifiedAt`

### v1 categories/create

Use this action to create a category.

Example:

```
{ "version": 1, "type": "categories/put", "payload": "Groceries" }
```

Rules:

1. IF `payload` is a non empty string
   AND no category matching `payload` exists
   THEN create a category using the `payload` value

### v1 categories/update

Use this action to rename a category:

```
{ "version": 1, "type": "categories/put", "payload": { "from": "Groceries", to: "Supermarket" } }
```

Rules:

1. IF a category matching `payload.from` exists
   AND `payload.to` is a non empty string
   THEN delete the category matching `payload.from`
   THEN create a category using the `payload.to` value
   THEN update all transactions that have `category == {payload.from}` so they have `category = {payload.to}`

Notes:

1. Renaming categories is not expected to be a common event. That is why there
   is no conflict detection mechanism for this event (and also why it's ok to
   have to go through ALL transactions and update their category value)

### v1 categories/delete

Delete a category:

```
{ "version": 1, "type": "categories/put", "payload": "Supermarket" }
```

Rules:

1. IF a category matching `payload` exists
   THEN delete the category matching `payload`
   AND update all transactions that have `category == {payload}` so they have `category = ""`

### v1 initialSavings/update

Use this action to set your "initial savings" value.

Example:

```
{ "version": 1, "type": "initialSavings/update", "payload": 100 }
```

Rules:

1. IF `payload` is a number
   THEN update "initial savings" to reflect the `payload` value

Notes:

1. By default: your "initial savings" value is 0, so there is no need to "create" it.
