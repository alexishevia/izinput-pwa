# To-Do
- [ ] download gdrive SpreadSheet
- [ ] append values to gdrive SpreadSheet
- [ ] create app that writes to indexedDB
- [ ] allow syncing indexedDB with Google Drive SpreadSheet
    I want to build something similar to
    https://github.com/alexishevia/redux-file-sync
    but I want to use a Google SpreadSheet as the cloud file, and I want to use an indexedDB for localStorage
