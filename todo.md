# To-Do
- [ ] on load, read existing transactions from DB and display them below the "new transaction" form
- [ ] allow creating "Income" transactions
- [ ] allow editing transactions
- [ ] allow syncing indexedDB with Google Drive SpreadSheet
    I want to build something similar to
    https://github.com/alexishevia/redux-file-sync
    but I want to use a Google SpreadSheet as the cloud file, and I want to use an indexedDB for localStorage
