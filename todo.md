# To-Do
- [ ] make sure the google sync is working on https://input.invoicezero.com/
- [ ] allow syncing with Google Drive
    I want to build something similar to
    https://github.com/alexishevia/redux-file-sync
    but I want to use a Google SpreadSheet as the cloud file, and I want to use an indexedDB for localStorage
