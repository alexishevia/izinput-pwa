# To-Do
- [ ] get this app deployed to input.invoicezero.com
- [ ] allow syncing with Google Drive
    I want to build something similar to
    https://github.com/alexishevia/redux-file-sync
    but I want to use a Google SpreadSheet as the cloud file, and I want to use an indexedDB for localStorage
